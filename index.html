It was established in 1948 by the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart (MSC) fathers. Its main campus is located at Atupan Street, Barangay 4 Poblacion, Nasipit, Agusan del Norte. The second campus is located in Brgy. Triangulo houses the elementary department.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Established in 1948 as a secondary school under the leadership of Fr. Martin Westeinde and Fr. Atanacio de Castro, Saint Michael College of Caraga (SMCC) has grown from a modest nipa-wooden structure to a thriving educational institution. Over the years, it transitioned from Dutch priest directors to layman leadership, expanding its academic offerings and infrastructure. Under the guidance of Msgr. Bienvinido A. Betaizar, SMCC evolved into a comprehensive educational hub, offering a wide array of programs from preschool to college, including technical and vocational courses accredited by TESDA. It continues to uphold its Catholic identity while adapting to the changing educational landscape of Agusan del Norte and the Caraga region.</p>   
                    <br>
                    <p>SMCC's journey is marked by milestones such as the establishment of the Teatro, Sayaw, at Awit Production (TESAW Production) and the introduction of various degree programs and technical courses. The institution's commitment to excellence is evident in its recognition as a Model TVET Provider School by TESDA Region XIII and its accreditation to accept foreign students. With a dynamic curriculum and modern facilities, SMCC remains a pillar of education, shaping the future of students in the region while staying true to its mission and vision.</p>
